# you will have to compare and apply the changes on your own.

# Since 7.1.0, the plugin will auto-rename the old config file into "config_old.yml" on server restart.
# This is to make sure everything works properly especially after a big update.
# You should have deleted the "config_old.yml" after migrating all the changes.
# Don't just leave it there as it may break the auto-rename function on future updates.

# Comments can be a bit lengthy here because we want to explain everything to you.
# If you do spend time reading through these messages, you will get a deep understanding about how Admin360 works.

# All messages, by default, contain all the placeholders that can be used on that particular message.
# You can remove it or duplicate it.

# HEX Colour Support
# This plugin supports HEX codes on 1.16+ servers.
# Example: "#e69296Your ping is #c8a2c8%ping% #e69296ms."

# /ticket history [#]: Honor Points History.
# This is a staff command which requires the permission "admin360.staff.history".

# This command is closely related to the Honor Points system.
# If a /ticket hpreset is executed, all the records related to that staff will also be removed.
# A ticket will only appear in the history as a record when it is completed. That's because tickets
# in other stages (in queue, in progress, awaiting feedback) will not be stored in the database.
# They will only be stored temporarily in RAM.

  # Set the number of records shown in history.
