# Do not change this unless you know what you're doing.
# This is for the plugin to check whether we should generate a new config for you.
version: '9.1.0'

# Whenever there's an update available, read the upgrade procedures as instructed on our spigot project page.
# If there are any changes made to this config, for example, if we've added several new options or messages,
# you will have to compare and apply the changes on your own.

# Since 7.1.0, the plugin will auto-rename the old config file into "config_old.yml" on server restart.
# This is to make sure everything works properly especially after a big update.
# You should have deleted the "config_old.yml" after migrated all the changes.
# Don't just leave it there as it may break the auto-rename function on future updates.

# As you can see, the comments can be a bit lengthy here because we want to explain everything to you.
# If you do spend time reading through these messages, you will have a good sense of how the plugin works.

# If you want to disable a message, simply makes it an empty line using ''.
# All messages, by default, contain all the placeholders that can be used on that particular message.
# You can remove it or duplicate it.

# We welcome users to provide feedback.
