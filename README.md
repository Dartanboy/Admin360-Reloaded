# Admin360-Reloaded

Have you ever been in a situation where many players need help, but there are only one or two admins online? If so, you should know how difficult it is to keep track of who needs help and in what order they asked for it. Another problem server owners often face is when hardworking players who get promoted to Admin start slacking off and not helping anymore. This plugin aims to solve both of these problems. <br><br>

## Motivation

First released by Vidhu in 2013, Admin360 is a lightweight but essential tool at all time. The new version aims to bring this inactive plugin back to life together with several major improvements to its base. Not only does it include better code, enhanced performance, and customizable configuration, the new version also introduces many new features and QoL changes. The plugin works with various versions of Spigot, and passed numeral stress tests on large survival servers with over 100 players. <br><br>

## Features

>**✔** simple and lightweight <br>
**✔** easy-to-understand config.yml <br>
**✔** works out-of-the-box <br>
**✔** MySQL and SQLite support <br>
**✔** 99% configurable

**Support Ticket System: <br>
Foster Disciplined And Quality Service <br>**
_Automated Queuing, Status Queries, Organised Notifications and Informative Statistics <br>_
The support ticket module empowers your players (with the appropriate permission) to seek assistance from your staff by creating support tickets while they are online. These tickets are automatically added to the queue based on the "First come, first serve" principle to ensure fairness. As a result, your staff can prioritize providing help rather than deliberating on determining the next in line. Additionally, peripheral features such as the ability to cancel or delete tickets, along with the option to view the status and statistics of the current system, are included, creating a comprehensive and efficient help-request processing system. This capability enables you to deliver top-notch service and ensure a high-quality experience for your players.

**Honour Point System: <br>
Create A Competitive Environment For Your Staff <br>**
_Feedback Collection, Professional Statistics and Competitive Leaderboard <br>_
The feedback system allows users to express their satisfaction with the service provided by staff members by awarding them an 'honour point' through positive ratings. Staff members have the ability to view both their own and their colleagues' honour points, introducing a sense of motivation and competition to strive for better ratings. Moreover, this feature enables server owners to assess the performance of their staff team effectively. By incorporating the honour point system, you can encourage staff engagement, incentivize quality service, and provide server owners with valuable insights into their team's performance. <br> <br>
