# Admin360-Reloaded

Have you ever found yourself in a predicament where there are 10 players seeking assistance, but only one or two administrators available online? If so, you are well aware of the immense challenge involved in keeping track of the players in need and determining the order in which help was requested. Additionally, numerous server owners encounter the issue of newly promoted diligent players, now holding the Admin rank or its equivalent, starting to slack off and neglect their responsibilities, leaving you overwhelmed as you strive to address matters and fulfill the duties that would typically be handled by five administrators. This plugin endeavors to tackle both of these predicaments. <br><br>

## Purpose

Admin360, originally developed by Vidhu, had been left abandoned for nearly 10 years. The reloaded version presented here attempts to bring substantial improvement to the product. Not only does it encompass extensive code optimization, enhanced performance, and a highly customizable configuration, it also introduces a plethora of new functionalities and quality-of-life enhancements. The plugin's compatibility with Spigot versions ranging from 1.7 to the latest release positions it as the ultimate administration solution for server owners worldwide. Additionally, Admin360-Reloaded has undergone rigorous stress testing on numerous large-scale survival servers, accommodating over 100 concurrent players. Impressively, no noteworthy performance or technical issues were discovered, thereby demonstrating its simplicity and lightweight nature. <br><br>

## Features

>**✔** simple and lightweight <br>
**✔** easy-to-understand config.yml <br>
**✔** works out-of-the-box <br>
**✔** MySQL and SQLite support <br>
**✔** 99% configurable

**Support Ticket System: <br>
Foster Disciplined And Quality Service <br>**
_Automated Queuing, Status Queries, Organised Notifications and Informative Statistics <br>_
The support ticket module empowers your players (with the appropriate permission) to seek assistance from your staff by creating support tickets while they are online. These tickets are automatically added to the queue based on the "First come, first serve" principle, ensuring a fair and organized approach. As a result, your staff can prioritize providing help rather than deliberating on who should be assisted first or determining the next in line. Additionally, peripheral features such as the ability to cancel or delete tickets, along with the option to view the status and statistics of the current system, are included, creating a comprehensive and efficient help-request processing system. This capability enables you to deliver top-notch service and ensure a high-quality experience for your players.

**Honour Point System: <br>
Create A Competitive Environment For Your Staff <br>**
_Feedback Collection, Professional Statistics and Competitive Leaderboard <br>_
The feedback system allows users to express their satisfaction with the service provided by staff members by awarding them an 'honour point' through positive ratings. Staff members have the ability to view both their own and their colleagues' honour points, introducing a sense of motivation and competition to strive for better ratings. Moreover, this feature enables server owners to assess the performance of their staff team effectively. By incorporating the honour point system, you can encourage staff engagement, incentivize quality service, and provide server owners with valuable insights into their team's performance. <br> <br>
