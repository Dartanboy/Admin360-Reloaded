# Admin360-Reloaded

Have you ever come into a situation when all of a sudden many of your players started crying for help and you simply had no idea how to get rid of the chaos? Who should be helped first? Who asked for help? While struggling, things get out of trace even more vastly. As an experienced server owner myself, I truly understand how stressful and helpless it can be.

Already feel the pain? But it's still not the end of the nightmare! Without much motivation, your staff may start lazing off and stop helping the server. You will then have to do the job of 5 admins and sort out all the things on your own...

Admin360 is here to tackle this challenge for you. Inspired by the Support Ticket System used in the field of project management in many big commercial companies, Admin360 is made to eliminate all these management chaos in a very systematic way. With automated queueing, feedback collecting, as well as a staff honour points leaderboard system, Admin360 provides a standardized workflow for handling help requests and create a competitive environment for your staff. <br><br>

## Admin360 vs Admin360-Reloaded

Admin360 is originally developed by vidhu1911 but the project had been abandoned for nearly 6 years. The reloaded version here is a fork, a better complement featuring a lot of code optimization, performance boost, highly customizable configuration, new major functions and many more. The fact that it supports Spigot 1.7 all the way up to the latest version has made it the best administration solution for global server owners. Admin360-Reloaded has also been stress-tested on several big survival servers (with 100+ concurrent players). No significant performance and technical issues were found. This proves how simple and lightweight it is. <br><br>

## Features

>**✔** simple and lightweight <br>
**✔** easy-to-understand config.yml <br>
**✔** works out-of-the-box <br>
**✔** MySQL and SQLite support <br>
**✔** 99% configurable

**Support Ticket System: <br>
Foster Disciplined And Quality Service <br>**
_Automated Queuing, Status Queries, Organised Notifications and Informative Statistics <br>_
The support ticket module allows your players (with the correct permission) to seek help from your staff by creating a support ticket when they are online. New tickets are automatically put in the next position of the queue following the principle of "First come, first serve". This allows your staff to focus more on helping instead of having to think about who should be helped first or who should be the next. Peripheral features such as the ability to cancel or delete tickets, and the ability to view the status and statistics of the current system is also included, making it a fully functional and efficient help-request processing system. This makes delivering quality service to your players possible.

**Honour Point System: <br>
Create A Competitive Environment For Your Staff <br>**
_Feedback Collection, Professional Statistics and Competitive Leaderboard <br>_
Staff can be awarded an 'honour point' by the feedback system if the users are satisfied with their service by giving a positive rating. It is possible for your staff to check the honour points of their own and the others. This adds some motives for your staff to compete for better ratings. It also helps server owners to evaluate the performance of your staff team. <br> <br>
